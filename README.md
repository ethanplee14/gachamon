# GACHAMON
I loved pokemon during my childhood. But now I'm an adult. I don't have the time to play anymore. And I hate my
life too much to enjoy games anyway, so time to develop a crippling addiction with my childhood memories and
gamble for pokemon.

### Releases
Major.Minor.Patch 
- 0.1.0 (9/6/2022) - Initial release!  

### TODO 
- [x] Pokemon Rolling endpoint. 
  - Roll generation, then roll for random pokemon, then roll for encounter chance. 
  - Think about how to handle encounter-methods for gift, giftegg, only-one
- [x] User account and setup <br>
  - [x] Authentication (Discord) 
  - [x] Username
  - [x] Store pokemon rolled
- [x] Limit rolling per profile per day 
- [x] Front-end polish

### Roadmap
- Tweak rolling algorithm to improve randomization and smoothen out rarity
- Consider leveling and stats.
  - Traditional 1-99 - Very familiar and plenty of model examples out there.
  - Pokemon go - rating may work better with the gacha rating system and fit with this game's style.
- Friends List for trading and battling
- Indirect grinding areas to gain items to increase roll chance. 
- Diverse roll areas to separate based on type?
